A prototype version of Lattice Element Modeling of the solid materials by python

Created by Yifan Wang, Dec. 2015

Spring Lattice Implementation:

  1. Read Lattice
  2. Calculate Elements
  3. Visualization

Simple Rectangular Case (Jan 6, 2016):

    rectangle discretisized by regular triangles.
    push the y dir from 7.8 to 6.4, Poisson's ratio approximately equal to 0.224

Case of Interface between Different Materials:

    2D, material A and B, 80nm x 65nm with 28nm crack in the middle (160524)
    build an interface model and contact model
